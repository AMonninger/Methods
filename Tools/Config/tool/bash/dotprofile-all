# What is a 'login or non-login shell'?

# When you login (type username and password) via console, either sitting at the machine, or remotely via ssh: .bash_profile is executed to configure your shell before the initial command prompt.

# But, if youâ€™ve already logged into your machine and open a new terminal window, then ~/.bashrc is executed before the window gives you a command prompt.  ~/.bashrc is also run when you start a new bash instance by typing /bin/bash in a terminal. ~/.profile is NOT executed again (though things inherited from it should still be present)
