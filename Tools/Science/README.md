The code herein constitutes a set of tools for systematically retrieving info about a scholar's research output
using Google Scholar. It builds on the tools scholar.py and PyScholar.py from GitHub.

Usage:

Prepare to run:

./inputs/auth_names_update.csv : Put here a csv set of information for each scholar you are interested in, identified by the headers
./inputs/auth_inst.csv         : Put here information on the institution with which the author is currently associated

Other tools that look promising are:
