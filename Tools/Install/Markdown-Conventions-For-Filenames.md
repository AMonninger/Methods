Below is a key for roughly how the limited puncuation that is
permitted in filenames, and used in some directories below, might be
translated into the richer punctuation and formatting available in
regular text.

0. The _ (underscore) is a strong separator, like a colon or semicolon, or maybe a comma

0. When a folder name ends in an underscore, it contains further content apropos to its subject

0. Dual underscores, like `__Expert-Mode__`, are like double quote marks `"` or maybe parentheses
