Organizing and keeping track of the privacy/visibility/sharing status of your computer records is 
a difficult challenge. For the purposes of this course I expect you to handle these issues 
using your Dropbox account and, within it, through the use of a directory structure that I have found increasingly
useful. 

Inside your /home/methods/Dropbox folder (henceforth, we will call it `droot` for dropbox root), you should 
have three subdirectories that are intended to be used to organize your files into three categories on the spectrum of 
possibilities between files that you intend to be totally private and not visible to anyone but you, to
files that you want to make available to the whole world.

0. `/pri`:  completely private; for work in progress, etc
0. `/shr`:  intended to be shared with someone who has permission that you have given them
0. `/pub`:  anyone can see it, Google can find it, and you can be admired by the world for your genius

By default, everything in all three of these directories starts out as private.  It's up to you to determine
sharing permissions for every file or directory therein, using the tools that Dropbox provides for sharing.

One principle that I have found to be quite useful in organizing differing levels of sharing is to have completely parallel folder structures below the droot which is either `/pri`, `/shr`/, or `/pub`.  If you are disciplined about this, then for any file you are looking at in one of the directory structures, you know exactly where to find other versions with different sharing characteristics.
