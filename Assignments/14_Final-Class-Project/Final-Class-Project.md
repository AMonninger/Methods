# The Final Project

The final project should be a REMARK, with a directory structure patterend on that of the BufferStockTheory REMARK.

You will "turn it in" by making a pull request to the econ-ark/REMARK repository,
from a "fork" of econ-ark/REMARK that you  will make when you begin your project.

## The project should satisfy the following requirements:

The "BufferStockTheory" REMARK provides a template.  You should substitute the
content appropriate for your project, but the structure of your REMARK should
parallel that of the BufferStockTheory REMARK

1. The root level directory should contain:
    * A brief README.md file explaining what the project is
    * A `do_all.py` file that can be executed from the command line via `ipython do_all.py`
       * This should produce all ALL of the computational results you have obtained
       * When it is run, the `do_all.py` file should print some facts about:
          * Execution time on some particular computational platform (like yours!)
       * If the `do_all.py` execution time is more than, say, 5 minutes:
          * There should also be a `do_min.py` file that runs in less than 5 minutes
          * It should produce some illustrative subset of the results
1. It should contain a Jupyter notebook (like "BufferStockTheory.ipynb") summarizes
the key results of your attempt to replicate the results of an existing paper
   * The overriding objectives are two:
      1. It should be as as clear as possible to someone using your REMARK how you obtained your results
      2. That person should be able, very easily, to reproduce those results themselves
   * To accomplish those objectives, you will need to do keep in mind several things:
      1. Your code should be well documented
      1. Aside from tools you use from the Econ-ARK/HARK toolkit, the REMARK should contain
         all the ingredients needed for someone else to be able to reproduce exactly
         what you have done AND to understand why you did what you did
      1. Notably, if you use scripts provided by me from the methods course, you need to
         copy those scripts to inside your REMARK's directory structure
           * Think of the audience of the REMARK as being a graduate student like yourself at the beginning of the semester
1. It should also contain a "paper" patterned on the BufferStockTheory paper.
1. Patterned, here, means that it should have:
   * A title page with your name(s) and appropriate links (assume that the PR for the paper will be accepted so that urls will be the ones that would be appropriate if it were already posted as a REMARK)
   * Some "body" text
   * At least one appendix
   * At least one figure (generated by your code) in the Figures directory, and retrieved therefrom
   * At least one table (ideally, generated by your code), in the Tables directory, and retrieved therefrom
   * At least one equation, created by the "verbatimwrite" command from within the paper and stored in the Equations directory
   * A slide deck with at least one slide
   * At least one BibTeX reference

## A suggestion

Probably the best way to think about the content of the "paper" versus the Jupyter notebook is to think of the paper as containing details that may be of interest only to someone deeply engaged in the topic. So, for example, if your Jupyter notebook contains a long section summarizing many minute details of the results of the original paper, which are not reproduced in the Jupyter notebook itself, you could include those details in the "paper" instead. The point of the paper is not really for you to create further original content beyond what is in the REMARK; it is to create a template that you can clone for the purposes of your own future projects, with examples of how to do all the key things you need to do. So, for example, it would be fine for your figure to be the same as a figure that is generated in your Jupyter notebook, or a slight variation thereof. And it would be fine for your Table to be generated by "echo" commands from the "doEverything.sh" bash script.

## What I Will Do When You Make Your "Pull Request" for the REMARK

You should be sure to have set things up so that I have permission to edit your
fork of the REMARK repository

So, if your GitHubID were BalassaB, and your project was BalssaSamuelson, when you issue the PR saying that your REMARK is ready,
from a bash shell I would perform the following steps:

    git clone https://github.com/BalassaB/REMARK.git
    cd REMARK/REMARKs/BalassaSamuelson
    ipython do_all.py
    ipython do_min.py
    ./make_paper.sh

Assuming all of those steps worked, I would then launch from the command line:

    jupyter notebook

and I would look through the BalassaSamuelson Jupyter notebook.
