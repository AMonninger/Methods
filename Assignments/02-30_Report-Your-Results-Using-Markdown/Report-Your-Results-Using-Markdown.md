This assignment is for you to learn to use emacs and Markdown and GitHub to give feedback on assignments

* Because I fiddle with the numbers that prefix the name of files, when you see `[Num]` below, that is a standin for whatever the actual numerical prefix is for the file in question. So, for example, I would refer to this file as `[Num]_Report-Your-Results-Using-Markdown.md`

1. For each assignment (starting with this one), follow the instructions in `How-To-Turn-In-Assignments` to create a copy of the assignment with the appropriate name (that is, with your moniker appended) at the appropriate place in your `/pri` directory

0. Now, you will edit each of the assignment files to add comments and feedback

0. All lines you add to the files should end with your initials (FirstMiddleLast, [FML])

0. For example, if this were a line I had added, it would end with [CDC]

0. For each line in the assignment that asks you to do something, you should make one of three responses

   0. If you executed the step with no difficulty and the instructions were easy to follow, you can just write Done [FML].  The next line provides an example, if I were a student, of how I would respond to the current line if I had finished going through all the assignments and had done everything:

      * Done [CDC]

   0. If the instructions were clear enough (in retrospect) but they were difficult to execute in practice, you might provide a response like

      * Done (but hard) [CDC]

   0. If the instructions were not clear enough for you to be able to figure out what to do and you were unable to accomplish it, you should provide a description of what you tried and your guess of why it failed.  For example, if you did not have write permission for the files and could not figure out how to grant yourself such permission, you might write:

      * I couldn't change the names of the files to add my moniker, and I couldn't edit them after I copied them to my `[droot]/pri/Methods/Assignments` directory  [CDC]

   0. When you find a place where you think the instructions should be improved or added to or clarified, you should post a GitHub "issue" containing your proposed edits. For example, you might want to edit the line earlier in the this assignment that reads:

       0. All lines you add to the files should end with your initials (FirstMiddleLast, [FML])
	   
	   instead to say
	   
       0. All lines you add to the files should end with your initials (FirstMiddleLast, [FML]). If you do not have a middle name, use the letter X [CXC]

   0. When you are done editing the assignments, you should be able to examine the resulting prettified Markdown document by hitting C-c C-c p (that is, Control-C, Control-C, p). You may want to search about this command online. (Google: `markdown editing mode in emacs`)
