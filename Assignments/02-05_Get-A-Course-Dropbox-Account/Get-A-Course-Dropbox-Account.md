You will need to have a Dropbox account with which to communicate with
me for the course. Most students will probably want to get a
`throwaway` free dropbox account, which you can do by giving to
Dropbox.com an email address that does not yet have a Dropbox account
associated with it. If you do not know of any email address that is
not already tied to a dropbox account, check out your personal profile
on my.jhu.edu where you will discover that JHU has probably
constructed several aliases to your @jhu.edu email account, and you
can give one of those aliases to Dropbox.
