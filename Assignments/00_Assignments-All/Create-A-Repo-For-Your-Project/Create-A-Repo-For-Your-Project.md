Your course project will exist in a repo you create in your GitHub account

0. Login to your GitHub account and create an empty repository named `Methods-Project`
   * do not even let GitHub create a README or LICENSE file
   * examine the instructions GitHub gives you for creating a local repo

0. Write a bash script that automatically performs the steps that GitHub tells you to perform manually
   * Name it `Methods-Project_[Moniker].sh`
   * The end result should be that you have on your virtual machine a local repo that is connected to your online remote GitHub repo

0. Once you have done all of this, invite `ccarrollATjhuecon` to be a `collaborator` on your repo
